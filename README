Implementation of an algorithm for procedurally-generating dungeons with Zelda-
like item-based puzzles.

See http://bytten.net/devlog/tag/metazelda/

To run after building:
    java -cp bin:viewer-bin net.bytten.metazelda.viewer.Main

It will randomly generate a graph and show it in the viewer.

F5 to generate a new dungeon.
Pass -seed=X to generate a dungeon from a specific seed.
Pass -space=spacemaps/skull.png to generate a dungeon in a specific shape.

If you're hacking on this, you'll want to start by understanding how
DungeonGenerator (the reference implementation) works.

LennasDungeonGenerator (enabled by passing -lenna on the command line) extends
DungeonGenerator in a few ways to produce more consistently interesting
dungeons. I plan to use this in my game, Lenna's Inception:
